Provides functions that raise errors in corner cases instead of returning \"best effort\"
results, then provides wrappers like the "Safe" module. For example:

* @'takeExact' 3 [1,2]@ raises an error, in contrast to 'take' which would return
  just two elements.

* @'takeExact' (-1) [1,2]@ raises an error, in contrast to 'take' which would return
  no elements.

* @'zip' [1,2] [1]@ raises an error, in contrast to 'zip' which would only pair up the
  first element.

Note that the @May@ variants of these functions are /strict/ in at least the bit of the prefix
of the list required to spot errors. The standard and @Note@ versions are lazy, but throw
errors later in the process - they do not check upfront.
